### Email 2: Day 3 Follow-Up
**Subject**: The most common "leak" we find

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share something interesting...

In 80% of the audits we conduct, we find at least one 
"phantom repair" - charges for maintenance that either:
- Never happened
- Was wildly overpriced
- Wasn't necessary

One client discovered $4,200 in questionable charges 
in just 3 months of statements.

Want us to review yours? It's complimentary.

### LinkedIn Post #1
```
Most luxury property owners blindly trust their management statements.

Big mistake.

In my years managing high-end rentals, I've seen:
→ $3,500 "repairs" that never happened
→ Vendors charging 2x market rate
→ Properties blocked for "maintenance" while the manager 
  rented them elsewhere

That's why I created a free Forensic Property Audit guide.

It reveals the 3 areas to check in your statements.

Interested? Comment "AUDIT" and I'll send it over.
