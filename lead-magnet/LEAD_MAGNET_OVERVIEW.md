## 📊 Success Metrics

### Track These Numbers

**Top of Funnel**
- Landing page views
- Download rate (target: 25-35%)
- Email open rate (target: 30-40%)

**Middle of Funnel**
- Consultation booking rate (target: 10-15% of downloads)
- Show-up rate for calls (target: 70-80%)

**Bottom of Funnel**
- Close rate (target: 30-50%)
- Average contract value
- Customer lifetime value

### Calculate ROI

```
Cost per Lead = (Ad Spend + Time) / Number of Leads
Cost per Client = Total Marketing Cost / Clients Signed
ROI = (Revenue - Cost) / Cost × 100

Example:
$500 ad spend → 40 downloads → 6 calls → 2 clients ($10K each)
Cost per Lead = $500/40 = $12.50
Cost per Client = $500/2 = $250
ROI = ($20,000 - $500) / $500 = 3,900%
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
1. **Asking for too much information** on form
   - Keep it simple: Name, email, maybe phone
   - More fields = lower conversion

2. **Waiting for perfection**
   - Launch with 80% done
   - Refine based on real feedback

3. **No follow-up sequence**
   - Most conversions happen in follow-up
   - Automate your emails

4. **Ignoring mobile users**
   - 60% of traffic is mobile
   - Test on your phone

5. **Not tracking metrics**
   - What gets measured gets improved
   - Use analytics

### ✅ Do This Instead
1. **Start simple** - Just name + email
2. **Launch fast** - Get feedback quickly
3. **Automate follow-up** - Email sequence is key
4. **Mobile-first** - Test on phone first
5. **Track everything** - Google Analytics + Formspree

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Use Video
Record a 2-minute Loom video walking through the PDF. Email it to leads who download but don't book a call.

### 2. Add Urgency
"Limited audit slots available this month" (but only if true!)

### 3. Personalize Follow-Up
Reference their specific property location in emails if they provided it.

### 4. Social Proof
Share screenshots of audit reports (with permission) showing real savings uncovered.

### 5. Multi-Channel
Don't just rely on one source. Email + Social + Ads + Partnerships = compound effect.
